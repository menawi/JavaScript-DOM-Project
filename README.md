Dodgeball: In this game, you control a character that needs to dodge incoming balls by moving it around the screen. Use the move elements and collide elements techniques to make the balls move and detect collisions with the character.

Maze Runner: Create a maze on the screen and control a character to navigate through it. Use the move elements technique to move the character and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with walls or obstacles.

Space Invaders: Create a space-themed game where you control a spaceship and need to shoot down incoming enemy spaceships. Use the move elements technique to move the spaceship and the collide elements technique to detect collisions between bullets and enemy spaceships.

Frogger: Create a game inspired by the classic Frogger, where you control a frog that needs to cross a busy road and a river. Use the move elements technique to move the frog and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with cars or logs.

Platformer: Create a platform game where you control a character that needs to jump and navigate through platforms to reach the end of the level. Use the move elements technique to move the character and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with platforms or enemies.

*1:advice: break these projects down into byte sized functions and then combine them to make the game. For example, you can create a function that moves an element, another function that detects collisions, and another function that handles the game logic. Then, you can combine these functions to create the game.
