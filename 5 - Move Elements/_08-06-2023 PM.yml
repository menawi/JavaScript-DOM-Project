  move:
    - Description: Defines movement functions for the player.
    - Steps:
      - Retrieves the player element with the 'Player-One' id.
      - Retrieves the game container element with the 'Game-Container-One' id.
      - Defines a movementUnit to adjust the player's position by 10 pixels in each direction.
      - Returns an object containing movement functions for left and right directions.
      - Each movement function adjusts the player's position within the game container's boundaries.
        - The 'left' function decreases the player's positionX by the movementUnit and ensures the player stays within the container's left boundary.
        - The 'right' function increases the player's positionX by the movementUnit and ensures the player stays within the container's right boundary.

  handleMovement:
    - Description: Implements event handling for player movement using arrow keys.
    - Steps:
      - Retrieves the movement object returned by the 'move' function.
      - Listens for 'keydown' events on the window.
      - Calls the appropriate player movement function based on the pressed arrow key.

Main Issues Faced:
- The game container was not centered initially, but it was resolved by setting appropriate styles, such as 'position: fixed' and 'margin: auto'.
- The 'createPlayer' function didn't return the player element, but it was resolved by adding the return statement.
- The 'move' function didn't return an object with movement functions for up and down directions, but it was corrected to return functions for left and right directions.

Current Issue:
- The 'handleMovement' function is not handling player movement for up and down directions since the 'move' function didn't return movement functions for these directions.

Next Session Plan:
- In the next session, we'll focus on updating the 'move' function to include movement functions for up and down directions and handle player movement for all directions in the 'handleMovement' function.
