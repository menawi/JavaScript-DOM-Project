# Part I and II List of Sections 

## Part I - Create
1. Create Elements
2. Append Elements 
3. Style Elements 

## Part II - Events
1. Select Elements 
2. Move Elements 
3. Collide Elements 

## Part III - Game Projects 
^[advice: break these projects down into byte sized functions and operations , and focus on absorbing the methods and skills rather than just finishing them]
1. Dodgeball: In this game, you control a character that needs to dodge incoming balls by moving it around the screen. Use the move elements and collide elements techniques to make the balls move and detect collisions with the character.

2. Maze Runner: Create a maze on the screen and control a character to navigate through it. Use the move elements technique to move the character and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with walls or obstacles.

3. Space Invaders: Create a space-themed game where you control a spaceship and need to shoot down incoming enemy spaceships. Use the move elements technique to move the spaceship and the collide elements technique to detect collisions between bullets and enemy spaceships.

4. Frogger: Create a game inspired by the classic Frogger, where you control a frog that needs to cross a busy road and a river. Use the move elements technique to move the frog and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with cars or logs.

5. Platformer: Create a platform game where you control a character that needs to jump and navigate through platforms to reach the end of the level. Use the move elements technique to move the character and the collide elements technique to detect collisions with platforms or enemies.

Based on Part I, here are three visual and fun projects I can do. They must involve movement, but not via keyboard or mouse. Just function based movement using timers and loops. 

1. Falling Snowflakes: Create a winter-themed project where snowflakes fall from the top of the screen and accumulate at the bottom. Use the create elements technique to generate multiple snowflake elements, the append elements technique to add them to the document, and the style elements technique to animate their movement downwards.

2. Bouncing Balls: Create a project where colorful balls bounce around the screen. Use the create elements technique to generate multiple ball elements, the append elements technique to add them to the document, and the style elements technique to animate their movement by changing their position and direction.

3. Animated Fireworks: Create a fireworks display where colorful explosions appear on the screen. Use the create elements technique to generate explosion elements, the append elements technique to add them to the document, and the style elements technique to animate their movement and appearance by changing their size, position, and opacity.
