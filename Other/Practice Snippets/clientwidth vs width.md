In the context of a DOM element, the "regular width" typically refers to the element's rendered width, which is determined by its content and any applied styling like width, padding, and borders. On the other hand, "clientWidth" is a specific property of DOM elements that represents the inner width of the element's content area, excluding padding and borders, but including the vertical scrollbar if it's visible.

Here's the difference between the two:

1. Regular Width:
   - The regular width refers to the total width of an element, including its content, padding, and borders. It encompasses the full space occupied by the element on the screen.
   - It includes the content box, the padding box, and the border box of the element.

2. Client Width:
   - The "clientWidth" property, specific to DOM elements, gives the inner width of an element's content area, excluding the padding and borders. It represents the space available for the content inside the element.
   - It includes only the content box of the element, excluding padding and border widths.

In summary, the regular width considers the full space occupied by the element on the screen, including its padding and borders, while the clientWidth focuses on the inner width available for the content within the element, excluding padding and borders but including the vertical scrollbar space if needed.
